## 🌐 HTML/CSS Mini Projects – My Early Frontend Journey

This repository is a collection of 4 beginner-level **HTML & CSS projects** I created during the early stages of my coding journey. These projects reflect my first steps in web development during **Semester 1 of Telecommunication Engineering in Pakistan**, before receiving a **fully funded scholarship to study Computer Science in Malaysia**.

Each project showcases a different concept — from landing pages to restaurant UIs and login forms.

## 📚 My Coding Story

> These projects represent my **first real steps** into the world of coding. While studying Telecommunication Engineering in Pakistan, I was deeply interested in websites and design.  
> That passion pushed me to explore frontend development and practice with real layouts.  
> Eventually, I received a **fully funded scholarship to study in Malaysia**, shifted to **Computer Science**, and began diving deeper into backend development and **Python** — but I’ve kept these HTML/CSS projects as proof of how I started.
